# Golang
Used for documenting my study of Golang.

Golang or Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed (at Google) by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.
Go is syntactically similar to C, but with Memory Safety, has Garbage Collection, Structural Typing and CSP-style concurrency.

Structural Typing type compatibility and equivalence are determined by the type's actual structure (or definition), and not by other characteristics such as its name or place of declaration
